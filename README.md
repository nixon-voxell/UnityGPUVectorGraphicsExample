# Unity GPU Vector Graphics Examples

This is an example project showcasing the [UnityGPUVectorGraphics](https://github.com/voxell-tech/UnityGPUVectorGraphics) package. Examples in this package will also be included in the package itself (as samples). However, those examples will only be updated once in a while. If you want the lastest example scenes, grab it here!

## Installation

2. And you are ready to go!
