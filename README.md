This is an example project showcasing the [UnityGPUVectorGraphics](https://github.com/voxell-tech/UnityGPUVectorGraphics) package. Examples in this package will also be included in the package itself (as samples). However, those examples will only be updated once in a while. If you want the lastest example scenes, grab it here!

## Installation

1. Just perform a recursive clone alongside all the submodules.
2. And you are ready to go!
